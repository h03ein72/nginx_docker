# ‚ö°Ô∏è Multi Hono.js Server Instances with NGINX & Docker  

Spin up scalable Hono.js apps using NGINX as a reverse proxy + load balancer. Perfect for handling traffic.


## üöÄ What's This About?

This repo shows you how to use NGINX to reverse proxy and load balance multiple Hono.js server instances. It's all containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scaling.


## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup with Docker

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h03ein72/nginx_docker.git
cd nginx_docker
```

### Build NGINX image
```bash
sudo docker build --target nginx -t nginx .
```

### Build Hono.js app image
```bash
sudo docker build --target honojs -t honojs .
```

### Now you are ready to compose up
```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

* -d: means detach mode

As you saw the docker compose file by now, the nginx port is 3000 on localhost, So...
```bash
open http://localhost:3000
```
